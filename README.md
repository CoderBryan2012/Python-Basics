# Python-Basics
Python basics include understanding variables, data types (like strings, integers, and floats), operators, control flow (conditionals and loops), functions, and data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.). 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Variables and Data Types:
Variables:
Variables are used to store data, and in Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable; Python infers it automatically.
Example: name = "Alice", age = 30, price = 19.99
Data Types:
Strings: Textual data enclosed in single or double quotes.
Integers: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
Floats: Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, -2.5).
Booleans: Represent truth values (True or False).
Lists: Ordered collections of items, enclosed in square brackets.
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces. 
2. Operators:
Arithmetic Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), ** (exponentiation), % (modulo).
Comparison Operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to).
Assignment Operator: = (assigns a value to a variable). 
3. Control Flow:
Conditional Statements (if, else, elif):
Used to execute different blocks of code based on conditions.
Example: if age >= 18: print("Eligible to vote") else: print("Not eligible")
Loops (for and while):
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
For loop: Iterates over a sequence (like a list).
While loop: Executes as long as a condition is true. 
4. Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
Example: def greet(name): print(f"Hello, {name}!") 
5. Data Structures:
Lists:
Ordered collections of items, mutable (can be changed).
Example: my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello"]
Dictionaries:
Unordered collections of key-value pairs, mutable.
Example: my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
Tuples:
Ordered collections of items, immutable (cannot be changed).
Example: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
Sets:
Unordered collections of unique items, mutable.
Example: my_set = {1, 2, 3} 
6. Modules:
Modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in other programs.
Example: import math 
7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Python supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Classes: Blueprints for creating objects.
Objects: Instances of a class.
